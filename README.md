# TIC TAC TOE Game

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows one players to play the game on a web page. The game starts with a select box where players can choose to play as either "X" or "O." Once the selection is made, the game board is displayed.

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players can take turns marking their chosen symbol in an empty cell. The current player's turn is indicated at the top of the board. The players can click on any empty cell to place their symbol. The game also includes a simple AI opponent (called "Jarvis") that randomly selects an empty cell to make its move.

The game continues until one of the players achieves a winning combination of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if all cells are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw. When the game ends, a result box is displayed, showing the winner or a draw message. The players have the option to replay the game by clicking the "Replay" button.

This project is for anyone who enjoys playing Tic Tac Toe and wants to play it on a web page. It can be used by individuals for leisure and entertainment purposes or as a learning resource for understanding web development concepts such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
